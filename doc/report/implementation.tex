\section {Implementation}

\subsection{Overview}
We implemented a small search engine that uses TweetRank to rank the tweets crawled from Twitter. The search engine has three main components: the crawler module, the \emph{ranker} module, and the Solr module. Figure \ref{fig:overview} represents the communication among the different components.

The crawler continuously fetches tweets from Twitter users using the Twitter API, saves the data to disk as a backup, parses it to extract the required information for our algorithms and sends the parsed data to the ranker and the Solr module. The crawler sends the data to Solr using XML its XML POST request specification and it sends data to the ranker using a protocol designed by us. The crawler was designed to run in multiple threads or multiple machines.

\subsection{Solr}
Solr 3.6 was used as the query interface for the TweetRank. It receives the tweets from the Crawler by XML POST requests and indexes them. To improve the usability we also make use of the built-in tf-idf scoring that is offered by Solr/Lucene.

The TweetRank scores are calculated at the ranker component which then prints the results as key value pairs in a plain text formatted file. This file is then used by Solr as an ''External file field'' which we multiply with the tf-idf score for the query. At last we also give some additional boost to the following attributes:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Hashtag} - If a hashtag $H$ is mentioned in the tweet $T$ and found in the query $Q$, we give additional score to $T$ for the query $Q$.
	\item \textbf{Username} - If the username of the author of tweet $T$ is found in query $Q$, we give additional score to $T$ for the query $Q$.
\end{itemize}
