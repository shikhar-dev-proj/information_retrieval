\section{TweetRank definition}\label{sec:tweetrank_definition}
TweetRank also defines the relevance of a tweet as the largest real eigenvector of a matrix $G'$, as PageRank did. However, our matrix will take into account not only the direct relationships among tweets (retweets and replies) but also other ways of reaching a tweet $j$ from tweet $i$:  
\begin{itemize}
\item $R_{i,j} = \frac{1}{|T|}$, random access probability.
\item $L_{i,j}$, probability of accessing tweet $j$ following a retweet or reply on tweet $i$.
\item $M_{i,j}$, probability of accessing tweet $j$ following a mention on tweet $i$.
\item $F_{i,j}$, probability of accessing tweet $j$ because the writer of tweet $j$ is a follower of tweet $i$'s writer. If several followers of $i$'s writer are available, one is randomly chosen. If the follower has written multiple tweets, one is randomly chosen.
\item $H_{i,j}$, probability of accessing tweet $j$ because both tweet $i$ and $j$ use the same hashtag. If several tweets $j$ are available, one is randomly chosen.
\end{itemize}

Given that, elements in $G'$ are defined as (with $\alpha + \beta + \gamma + \delta + \epsilon = 1$):
\begin{equation}\label{eq:tweetrank}
G'_{i,j} = \alpha R_{i,j} + \beta L_{i,j} + \gamma M_{i,j} + \delta F_{i,j} + \epsilon H_{i,j}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{$L_{i,j}$ approximation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ref_prob}
L_{i,j} = RT_{i,j} + RP_{i,j}
\end{equation}

The previous equation uses the result of equations \ref{eq:retweet_rel} and \ref{eq:reply_rel}. Note that a tweet can be either a retweet, a reply or none of them (new post). So, $RT_{i,j} + RP_{i,j}$ is equal to 0 or 1, and there are at most one non-zero element in the $i$-th row of matrix $L$.

\subsubsection*{$M_{i,j}$ approximation}
First, probability of visiting the profile of a user $j$ from a mention in a tweet $i$ is defined as $FM_{i,j}$. Remember that $m_i$ was defined as the number of mentions in tweet $i$. This definition uses the result of equation \ref{eq:mention_rel}. Then $M_{i,j}$ is defined in equation \ref{eq:mentions_probability}.

\begin{equation}
FM_{i,j} = \begin{cases}
\frac{MN_{i,j}}{m_i} & \text{if } m_i > 0 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:mentions_probability}
M_{i,j} = \frac{FM_{i, u_j}}{ |t \in T : u_t = u_j|}
\end{equation}
Note that $|t \in T : u_t = u_j|$ is just the number of tweets from user $u_j$.

\subsubsection*{$F_{i,j}$ approximation}
In the first place, probability of visiting the profile of user $j$ accessing the following list of user $i$ is defined as $FF_{i,j}$. Note that $f_i$ is the number of users followed by user $i$. Using this probability, $F_{i,j}$ is defined in \ref{eq:follows_probability}.
\begin{equation}
FF_{i,j} = \begin{cases}
\frac{FW{i,j}}{f_i} & \text{if } f_i > 0 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:follows_probability}
F_{i,j} = \frac{FF_{u_i, u_j}}{ |t \in T : u_t = u_j|}
\end{equation}
Note that $|t \in T : u_t = u_j|$ is just the number of tweets of user $u_j$.

\subsubsection*{$H_{i,j}$ approximation}
First, let's define the probability that a tweet $j$ is visited from tweet $i$, using the hashtag $k$. Remember that $ht_k$ denotes the number of tweets that use the hashtag $k$ and $th_i$ denotes the number of hashtags that are included in tweet $i$.

\begin{equation}
HP_{i,j,k} = \begin{cases}
\left( \frac{ HT_{j,k} }{ ht_k } \right) \cdot \left( \frac{ HT_{i,k} }{ th_i } \right) & \text{if } ht_k > 0 \wedge th_i > 0 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Note that $HP_{i,j,k}$ will be greater than zero if, and only if, both $i$ and $j$ use the hashtag $k$. 

Then, $H_{i,j}$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
H_{i,j} = \sum_{k \in HS} HP_{i,j,k}
\end{equation}
